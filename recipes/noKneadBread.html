        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 cups room temperature water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, 
                and yeast together until mixed. Stir in the water 
                until a chunky, thick dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let it 
                rest for 12-18 hours at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450 Fahrenheit, and stick a 6 quart enamel coated 
                cast iron Lodge Dutch Oven (or similar) in the oven for 
                about 30 minutes to heat.</li>
            <li>Gently scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface, 
                shape it into a ball with flour on the outside, 
                set on a piece of parchment, and cover with plastic while 
                your Dutch Oven heats up.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic from the dough. Lift the dough and 
                parchment together into the pan so the parchment 
                lines the bottom of the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Bake, covered, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the cover and bake another 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
